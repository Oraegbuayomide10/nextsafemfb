                          (the “Overdraft Facility”) on your NextSave account 
                          (“Account”). This Overdraft Facility is linked to
                           your Account and will allow you withdraw

                        You are required to repay the Overdraft Facility and the Interest on or before the Maturity Date and NextSave is hereby authorised to automatically debit your account on the Maturity Date to settle the Overdraft Facility and any accrued interests (“Outstanding Balance”). Where the Outstanding Balance is not paid in full by the Maturity Date, the Overdraft Facility shall be treated as being in arrears and any credit in your Account shall automatically be applied by NextSave towards the settlement of the Outstanding Balance.
                            You may fully prepay the Overdraft Facility prior to the scheduled Maturity Date by paying to NextSave, the Outstanding Balance, together with other monies due under this Offer Letter up to the date of such prepayment.
                            Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions, NextSave may require you to repay the Outstanding Balance in full or any part thereof on demand by issuing a repayment notice of at least 7 (seven) business days.

                           NextSave will charge you interest on a daily basis at the rate of 0.3% of the Overdraft Facility during the Tenor. This interest will, however, only be applicable and begin to accrue if you do not pay back the Overdraft Facility to NextSave by midnight on the Disbursement Date.

                            Interest will be paid by you, together with the Overdraft Facility as stated in clause 2.1 above during the Tenor until full repayment of the Outstanding Balance.
